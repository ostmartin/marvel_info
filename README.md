1\. The project is built with the React library, Create React App is used.

3\. WebPack is used as a bundler.

4\. The useState hook was used to work with the state, also the FSM method was used.

5\. The form was created using Formik library and validated using Yup.

6\. React-Router v5.3 was used for routing.

7\. React-Helmet library is also used.

React-Transition-Group does not work correctly in this project (removed).

In the project I practice creating and using own custom hooks `useHttp`, `useMarvelService`.
